# TASK Number 1 : NUMBER GAME
The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides a hint indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, until the correct number is guessed. 

# How to Play
Run the Java program.

The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

You will be prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the game will tell you:

"Too low" if your guess is smaller than the number.

"Too high" if your guess is greater than the number.

Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.

Once guessed correctly, the game will display a congratulatory message.
